## 16-Hour Fast (16/8 Intermittent Fasting)

The 16-hour fast, commonly known as the 16/8 intermittent fasting method, involves fasting for 16 hours each day and restricting eating to an 8-hour window. This approach is popular for its simplicity and potential health benefits.

### Overview

- **Fasting Duration:** 16 hours
- **Eating Window:** 8 hours

### Stages

1. **Pre-Fast (Preparation):**
